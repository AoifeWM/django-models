# django-models
By Aoife Mulligan

A simple Django website used to learn about database models.
Formatted as a "snacks list."

## Setup:
PORT: 8000
To run the application: 
`python manage.py runserver`
To create and modify snacks and users, go to 0.0.0.0:8000/admin.
The snacks list view is 0.0.0.0:8000
Individual snack views are 0.0.0.0:8000/1, 0.0.0.0:8000/2, etc.

## Tests:
`python manage.py test`
Tests that the pages are up and running and that the model is behaving properly.
